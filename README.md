# 🎬 MovieMatch AI

> **Live Demo:** [Click here to try MovieMatch instantly!](https://moviematch-55.streamlit.app)

An intelligent, content-based movie recommendation engine that analyzes genres, cast, directors, and plot keywords using **Cosine Similarity**, paired with real-time sentiment analysis powered by **Google Gemini**.

---

### Project Overview

**MovieMatch** is a content-based movie recommendation engine that suggests films based on deep feature similarity rather than simple genre matching. Given 3 user-selected movies, the system identifies the strongest pairwise similarity and generates 4 tailored recommendations by analyzing multiple content dimensions simultaneously.

The app also includes a **sentiment analysis layer** — after receiving recommendations, users can describe how they felt about the suggested movies, and a Google Gemini LLM analyzes the emotional tone of their feedback in real time.

### How It Works

#### 1. Feature Engineering Pipeline
The raw [TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata) (5,000 movies with full cast/crew metadata) is processed through a feature engineering pipeline that converts categorical movie attributes into binary vector representations:

| Feature | What It Captures | Encoding |
|---------|-----------------|----------|
| `genres_bin` | Genre tags (Action, Comedy, Drama, etc.) | Multi-hot binary vector |
| `cast_bin` | Top-billed cast members | Binary presence vector |
| `director_bin` | Film director | Binary indicator vector |
| `words_bin` | Plot keywords and overview terms | Binary bag-of-words vector |

#### 2. Multi-Dimensional Similarity Scoring
Instead of matching on a single attribute, the system computes a **composite distance score** between any two movies by summing cosine distances across all 4 feature vectors:

```
similarity(A, B) = cosine_dist(genres) + cosine_dist(cast) + cosine_dist(director) + cosine_dist(keywords)
```

This multi-dimensional approach captures nuanced relationships — two movies might share a director and genre but differ in cast, and the system accounts for all of these dimensions simultaneously.

#### 3. Recommendation Strategy
When a user selects 3 movies:
1. **Pairwise Comparison** — The system computes similarity between all 3 pairs (A↔B, B↔C, A↔C)
2. **Strongest Pair Selection** — Identifies the 2 movies with the smallest distance (most similar pair)
3. **K-Nearest Neighbor Search (K=2)** — For each movie in the strongest pair, finds the 2 nearest neighbors from the full dataset
4. **Result** — Returns 4 recommendations (2 per movie) that align with the user's strongest taste signal

#### 4. Sentiment Analysis
After receiving recommendations, users can type free-text feedback. This feedback is sent to **Google Gemini (gemini-1.5-flash)** which analyzes the sentiment and provides a natural language response about the user's emotional reaction.
